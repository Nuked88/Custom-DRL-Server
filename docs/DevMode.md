# Dev mode
## Giving Dev Mode
When you are given the attribute of "profile-developer" = true in your state file it unlocks dev mode.

## Dev Mode uses
Dev Mode allows who ever has it to publish maps to the Main tracks thingy more on that [here](docs/Tracks.md). It also seems to allow for recording of replays in some sort of special way but that needs a program named recorder.exe, which is not present in the game files. May be able to recreate it from function calls. There doesn't seem to be other uses, although I haven't done too much digging.
